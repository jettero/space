# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
- Package code: `space/` (see `setup.cfg` and `pyproject.toml`).
- Tests: `t/` (configured via `pytest.ini:testpaths = t`).
- Build artifacts: `build/`, `dist/`, `space.egg-info/`.
- Config/tooling: `Makefile`, `pytest.ini`, `.pre-commit-config.yaml`,
  `pylintrc`.
- Requirements: `requirements.txt` (runtime), `test-requirements.txt`
  (dev/test). Markers: `reqs`, `mods`.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
- `make` or `make test` — run test suite (`pytest t`).
- Parallel runs: prefer using available CPUs instead of a fixed `-j`.
  - Examples: `make test -j"$(nproc)"` (Linux), `make test -j"$(sysctl -n
    hw.ncpu)"` (macOS), or set `-j16` if you know your core count.
  - Avoid small fixed values like `-j2` on multi-core machines.
- `pre-commit run --all-files` — run linters/formatters (pylint, black, hooks).
- `python -m build` — build sdist/wheel (also via `make build`) when cutting
  releases.
- `pip install -Ur test-requirements.txt` — install test-only deps if needed
  (`make reqs`).

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- Lint: `pylint` (configured by `pylintrc`). Format: `black` (via pre-commit).
- Indentation: 4 spaces; UTF-8; Unix newlines.
- Naming: modules `snake_case.py`; classes `CamelCase`; functions/vars
  `snake_case`; constants `UPPER_SNAKE`.
- Keep modules focused; prefer small, testable functions. Type hints encouraged
  for public APIs.

### Markdown Formatting
- Wrap Markdown text at ~80 characters per line.
- Keep prose concise; avoid unnecessary verbosity.

### Map/Generator Conventions
- Floors: use `Floor` for room interiors, `Corridor` for hallways; both subclass
  `Cell` and render the same by default.
- Walkability checks: use `isinstance(x, Cell)` instead of checking subclasses.
- Partition smoothing: `Map.cellify_partitions()` opens partitions as `Corridor`
  tiles; keep docstrings brief.
- Color: default colorized output treats floors/corridors with the same grey
  (`boring_color`). Avoid per-type hues unless explicitly requested.

## Testing Guidelines
- Framework: `pytest` (see `pytest.ini` for `-v --ff --show-capture=stderr
  --maxfail=1`).
- Tests live in `t/`; name files `test_*.py`. Use `-k name` for focused runs.
- Keep tests deterministic; avoid network; isolate I/O (tmp paths/fixtures).
- Run `make test` before commits. Prefer small, verifiable changes; avoid
  unrelated fixes in the same patch.

### Test Style
- Prefer assertive code over comments; keep tests self-explanatory.
- When asserting exceptions, use `pytest.raises(..., match=regex)` to check
  the error message, not just the type.
- For parse failures, assert `not pstate`, `pstate.winner is None`, and check
  any available `pstate.error` text when relevant.

### Test Naming
- Use concise, descriptive function names that encode input and outcome.
- Positive parse cases: `test_open_door`, `test_open_south_door`.
- Negative parse cases end with `_fail`/`_fails`:
  `test_open_north_door_fail`, `test_open_nonsense_fails`.
- Multi-step flows describe the sequence succinctly:
  `test_open_door_and_move_through_it`.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
- Commits: imperative subject line (<=72 chars); explain rationale when
  non-trivial.
- Keep diffs focused; reference issues (e.g., `Fixes #123`).
- PRs: include summary, motivation, test coverage, and any UX/build notes or
  screenshots.
- CI must pass: tests (`make test`) and hooks (`pre-commit`).

## Notes on Versioning & Build
- Version is generated by `setuptools_scm` into `space/version.py` (see
  `pyproject.toml`).
- Do not edit `space/version.py` manually; tag releases via Git to bump version
  metadata.
- For local development, do not install the package; run tests directly via
  `make test`.

## Agent Tips
- Be concise. Add minimal docstrings that explain purpose and key args; avoid
  long narratives.
- When adding flags like `cellify_partitions=True`, document with a very short
  phrase (e.g., "open short partitions").
- Prefer surgical changes; don’t refactor broadly unless asked.
- Respect `pytest.ini` settings; use `rg` for repo scans; read files in
  ≤250-line chunks.
- Only add code comments when they materially improve clarity. Avoid
  redundant or obvious comments; keep necessary comments short and direct.
 - Do not add conversational or meta comments in code. Comments must be about
   the code itself, not about prior discussion or rationale external to the
   codebase.
 - We favor TDD: add a failing test first, then implement the minimal
  code to make it pass. Keep tests focused, deterministic, and aligned with
  the current map/verb conventions.

## Python Version & Style Notes

- Target runtime: Python 3.8+ semantics, but avoid modern annotation syntax in
  function signatures (no `def fn(...) -> T` or union `A | B`).
- Prefer classic style definitions without return‑type annotations. Use docstrings
  or comments for type hints where helpful.
